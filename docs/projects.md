## Raqcoin

**RAQ · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** The 2018 milestone is ABCMint genesis, not UOV deployment. Community materials describe a 2022 rename.

**Consensus:** PoW.

**Cryptographic use:** RainbowPro and UOV configurations; multisig is a separate capability.

**Crypto-agility:** Key configuration selects the signing scheme. Existing keys do not change automatically.

**Limits:** The guide lists Rainbow configuration 274 as the default. Legacy ABCMint Rainbow parameters have a public break. New configurations require separate analysis; NIST UOV candidate parameters are not Raqcoin deployment parameters.

## Mochimo

**MCM · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** Mainnet launched in June 2018.

**Consensus:** PoS after the October 2026 migration; historically PoW.

**Cryptographic use:** WOTS+ transaction signatures.

**Crypto-agility:** One active signing scheme in the reviewed material.

**Limits:** Consensus changed; the signing scheme remained WOTS+. No claim that a future protocol upgrade could never change it.

## QRL

**QRL · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** Mainnet launched in June 2018.

**Consensus:** QRL 1.x mainnet uses PoW; QRL 2.0 PoS was a testnet in this snapshot.

**Cryptographic use:** XMSS transaction signatures.

**Crypto-agility:** Hash-function choice and descriptor fields; not arbitrary switching between signature families.

**Limits:** XMSS is stateful. The RFC size example is not QRL transaction serialization.

## Nexus

**NXS · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** November 2019 is the Tritium upgrade, not the original chain genesis in 2014.

**Consensus:** PoW and PoS channels.

**Cryptographic use:** Opt-in Falcon-512; classical Brainpool signatures remain valid.

**Crypto-agility:** Signature chains commit to a subsequent key and scheme.

**Limits:** Do not treat every Nexus account as post-quantum.

## Tidecoin

**TDC · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** Genesis was December 27, 2020.

**Consensus:** PoW; the reviewed default mainnet parameters disable the AuxPoW activation gate.

**Cryptographic use:** Falcon-512 active; Falcon-1024 and ML-DSA exist in upgrade code.

**Crypto-agility:** Multiple schemes are implemented behind an activation gate.

**Limits:** Implemented upgrade support does not establish that it is active on mainnet.

Sources:

## Starknet

**STRK · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** November 2021 is L2 Mainnet Alpha, not an independent L1 launch.

**Consensus:** Ethereum L2 with a phased PoS rollout.

**Cryptographic use:** STARK validity proofs and a Falcon-512 account demonstration.

**Crypto-agility:** Account abstraction and contract upgrades can change account verification logic.

**Limits:** A Falcon account demo is not migration of every account. Ethereum settlement and bridge dependencies remain. The L1 vote supported research, not a move.

## Abelian

**ABEL · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** Mainnet launched in April 2022.

**Consensus:** Dual PoW: ABEL-ETHash and ABEL-Nakamoto after the Aconcagua upgrade.

**Cryptographic use:** Custom lattice-based PQRingCT/PQRingCTX schemes.

**Crypto-agility:** Versioned cryptographic schemes; mining algorithm choice is a separate matter.

**Limits:** These schemes are not ML-DSA. Dual PoW does not mean PoW plus PoS. QDay is a separate L2.

## Algorand

**ALGO · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** The timeline uses the 2022 State Proofs milestone. The chain launched in 2019.

**Consensus:** Pure Proof of Stake.

**Cryptographic use:** Falcon State Proofs and opt-in Falcon account authorization.

**Crypto-agility:** Rekeying and programmable authorization; native Falcon-1024 accounts are also documented.

**Limits:** State Proofs and account signing have different roles. Consensus participation keys remain classical; app and wallet support still matters.

## Cellframe

**CELL · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** Native mainnet launched in July 2023.

**Consensus:** PoS on the main transaction chain; PoA on the zerochain.

**Cryptographic use:** Native-wallet options include Dilithium, Falcon and SPHINCS+.

**Crypto-agility:** Multiple native signing schemes, subject to network and wallet support.

**Limits:** Scope is native CF-20 assets, not ERC-20/BEP-20 tokens. Picnic is a historical/deprecated route, not a current wallet option in this release.

Sources:

- [cell-launch](https://cellframe.medium.com/ama-with-ceo-dmitry-gerasimov-july-13-2023-f317f5fb1de0) — July 12, 2023 mainnet launch. (project documentation)

## QuantumCoin

**Q · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** Mainnet launched on December 31, 2023.

**Consensus:** PoS with deposit-weighted BFT.

**Cryptographic use:** Hybrid post-quantum and Ed25519 signing; ML-DSA and SLH-DSA components.

**Crypto-agility:** Signing modes change at protocol thresholds and in emergency mode.

**Limits:** Do not assume every protocol phase uses exactly the same component combination. ML-KEM node handshakes are not transaction signatures.

## QANplatform

**QANX · testnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** May 2024 is the public testnet announcement, not a public mainnet launch.

**Consensus:** PoA on the reviewed public testnet; PoS is planned.

**Cryptographic use:** XLINK pairs ML-DSA-65 with secp256k1.

**Crypto-agility:** A fixed signature pairing in the reviewed XLINK path.

**Limits:** The traded QANX token does not establish a live native post-quantum mainnet. The original 2024 announcement used the Dilithium name; do not backdate current parameters.

## Neptune Cash

**NPT · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** First launch in February 2025; the current chain relaunched on August 5, 2025.

**Consensus:** PoW.

**Cryptographic use:** Hash-preimage spending conditions and Triton STARK validity proofs.

**Crypto-agility:** Programmable lock scripts.

**Limits:** A STARK proof and a hash-preimage spending condition are not a fixed-size standard digital signature.

## Nervos CKB

**CKB · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** January 2026 marks the SPHINCS+ lock deployment. CKB mainnet launched in 2019.

**Consensus:** PoW, using NC-Max and Eaglesong.

**Cryptographic use:** An opt-in SPHINCS+ spending lock.

**Crypto-agility:** New verification logic can be deployed as lock scripts.

**Limits:** Existing cells must satisfy their old spending rules before migration. Default secp256k1 cells do not change automatically.

Sources:

- [ckb-lock](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/quantum-resistant-lock-script/tree/082c0a19ce4e0b2c0b00f7b46f423f59a30afc71) — SPHINCS+ implementation and mainnet deployment parameters. (pinned source repository)

## Quantus

**QTC · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** Mainnet launched on September 9, 2026.

**Consensus:** PoW with Poseidon2 mining.

**Cryptographic use:** ML-DSA-87 and ML-DSA-65 transaction signing.

**Crypto-agility:** Parameter-set selection within ML-DSA.

**Limits:** ML-DSA-65 requires runtime spec 139 or later and compatible account tooling. Quantus and qtcchain both use QTC but are separate chains.

## xCoin

**XID · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** The project whitepaper dates mainnet genesis to September 26, 2026.

**Consensus:** PoW, using MetalDAG.

**Cryptographic use:** ML-DSA-65 primary signing; SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s fallback leaves.

**Crypto-agility:** Cross-family fallback requires committing to the alternative spending leaf in advance.

**Limits:** This is not a claim that every spend carries both signatures or that a new fallback can be added after a key is compromised.

- [xid-explorer](https://superknet.com/) — Public chain activity; not proof of adoption. (ecosystem block explorer)

## qtcchain

**QTC · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** v1 launched September 30, 2026; v2 re-genesis was October 5, 2026.

**Consensus:** PoW with MatMul mining.

**Cryptographic use:** ML-DSA-44 primary signing; SLH-DSA fallback/multisig.

**Crypto-agility:** Per-key scheme selection and multiple script leaves.

**Limits:** Falcon is reserved in the reviewed specification. qtcchain is unrelated to Quantus despite the shared QTC ticker. The repository records a v2 treasury allocation; inclusion is not a fair-launch endorsement.

## Soqucoin

**SOQ · mainnet · reviewed 2026-10-23**

**Milestone:** Mainnet block 1 was mined on October 13, 2026.

**Consensus:** Scrypt PoW with AuxPoW support.

**Cryptographic use:** ML-DSA-44 transaction signing.

**Crypto-agility:** One active transaction-signing scheme in the snapshot.

**Limits:** XMSS experiments are not counted as a mainnet signing path. Public blocks do not establish user adoption or independent security certification.
